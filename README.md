# K-means

This repositry contains the python implementation of K-means clustering algorithm (Unsupervised learning algorithm).

Applied the k-means on a matlab data from Machine learning course from stanford university by Andrew ng.

We assign the points, then we move the cetroids, that's how it goes.

## Requirements 

These models has been tested and developed using the following libraries: 

    - python==3.8.2
    - numpy==1.13.3
    - matplotlib==3.2.1
    - scipy==1.4.1

    
I recommend using at least these versions of the required libraries or later. Python 2 is not supported.
